# AMD-Instinct-GPU-Training

This course will give a deep dive into the AMD Instinct™ GPU architecture and its ROCm™ ecosystem, including the tools to develop or port HPC or AI applications to AMD GPUs. Participants will be introduced to the HIP (Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability) programming language for AMD GPUs, other higher-level GPU programming models such as OpenMP, OpenACC, and performance portable programming models such as Kokkos.
In addition, there will be presentations on other important topics such as GPU-Aware MPI, and Affinity. The AMD tool suite, including the debugger, rocgdb, and the profiling tools rocprof, omnitrace, and omniperf will also be covered. A short introduction will be given into the AMD Machine Learning software stack including PyTorch and Tensorflow and how they have been used in HPC.



After this course, participants will

- have learned about the many GPU programming languages for AMD GPUs
- understand how to get performance scaling
- have gained knowledge about the AMD programming tools
- have gotten an introduction to the AMD Machine learning software
- know about profiling and debugging.
